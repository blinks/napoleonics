# Untitled Napoleonic Wars Game
Napoleonic Wars x Up Front.

## Objective
As Napoleon, bring Europe under your thumb. As the Coalition, keep Napoleon in check without going broke.

## Components
- A 20-area map of Europe and the surrounding area.
- Tokens (or cylinders) for National Will / Resources of each participant.
- A pile of chits for infantry / cavalry / artillery divisions.
- Two decks of cards (one for Napoleon, one for the Coalition).
  - 1 to 6 ops, doubling as a die roll.
  - Map cards: rivers, villages, cities. Each has a fixed mark for the defender's position (so the defender's standee can remain on the strategic map), while attackers (and reinforcements) are placed on the card in their tactical position.
  - Leader cards: used to split armies.
  - Event cards: for various bits of chrome.

## Setup
Scenario-driven. For the first prototype, we'll work on the 1805 Ulm campaign leading up to Austerlitz in the [War of the Third Coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Third_Coalition).

- Fr. General Napoleon and 200k in Northern France.
- Au. General Mack and 200k in the Black Forest.
- Ru. General Kutusov and 100k in Russia.

(How many chits should this be? Perhaps 20k per cube?)

Each player draws to their hand size, probably seven for the prototype. Players are also divided amongst the possible army groups, such that each player is on at most one side (France or the Coalition).

## Play
On your turn, activate a leader or regroup.

### Activate
Choose a leader and play a card for ops. Move that leader on the map.

- Strategic movement: each dot costs an OP to traverse. You must stop once reaching a new area.
- Engage to start a battle: play a terrain card from your hand to their leader. They may respond by playing ops (based on the terrain card) to refuse battle or position the attacker. Otherwise, you position yourself on the card.
- Engage to join a battle: place yourself on an already-played terrain card.
- Disengage: Attempt to leave a battle. Any attacker can play a higher-ops card to block you. Cavalry can be spent to add to a card's ops for this purpose.
- Fight: Spend a chit from an engaged leader (instead of a card), and draw from your deck at random to determine the result.

### Regroup
Clear out the cards played to each leader. For disengaged leaders, clear out all their cards. For engaged leaders, clear out a single card and recover any spent chits.
