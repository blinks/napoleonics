# Untitled Napoleonic Wars Game
Napoleonic Wars x Up Front.

## Objective
As Napoleon, bring Europe under your thumb. As the Coalition, keep Napoleon in check without going broke.

## Components
- A 20-area map of Europe and the surrounding area.
- Tokens (or cylinders) for National Will / Resources of each participant.
- A single ten-sided die, from 0 to 9.
- A pile of cubes for strength points.
- Two decks of cards (one for Napoleon, one for the Coalition).
  - 2 sets of Move cards from 1 to 10
  - 2 sets of Battle / Regroup cards from 1 to 10
  - Map cards: rivers, villages, cities.
  - Leader cards?

## Setup
Scenario-driven. For the first prototype, we'll work on the 1805 Ulm campaign leading up to Austerlitz in the [War of the Third Coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Third_Coalition).

- Fr. General Napoleon and 200k in Northern France.
- Au. General Mack and 200k in the Black Forest.
- Ru. General Kutusov and 100k in Russia.

(How many cubes should this be? Perhaps 20k per cube?)
